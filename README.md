## Usage

```fish
wezl - A simple layout manager for Wezterm.

Usage:
  wezl [OPTIONS] LAYOUT_STRING

Options:
  --new-window        Create layout in a new window
  --cwd <DIRECTORY>   Specify the current working directory
  --help              Show this help message

Layout string syntax:
  |  - New tab
  /  - Vertical split
  =  - Horizontal split

The layout string is executed in sequence, meaning each character is applied sequentially to create the desired layout.

Examples:
  wezl '||=//='
  wezl --new-window --cwd /path/to/directory '||=//='

For the example given:

Tab 1:

+---------------------+
|        Pane 1       |
+---------------------+

Tab 2:

+---------------------+
|        Pane 2       |
+---------------------+
|          |    |  5  |
|  Pane 3  | 4  |-----|
|          |    |  6  |
+----------+----------+
